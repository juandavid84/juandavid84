Hi, I am a Full Stack Developer.

I always want to learn more details about programming and design languages. I plan to grow in this field.

Academic Experience: I studied in Henry Bootcamp. I was Teaching Assistant Bootcamp Assistant (TA) for Full-Stack Development students. My function was coordinating a group of people to achieve integration into the study group. I helped the students with the resolution of exercises. My goal was to promote group colaboration in order to improve the Bootcamp's process.

Moreover, I created and developed a Single Page Application. The theme was Countries with the use of the following technologies: React, Redux, Javascript, PostgreSQL, Sequelize, CSS and Express.

Languages and Tools:

Bootstrap, CSS, Express, Git, HTML5, Javascript, NodeJS, PostgreSQL,React, Redux.
